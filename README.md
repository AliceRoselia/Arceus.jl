Arcane entity management system (to be) written with performance in mind.

(Planned) features include

- Weight-based job assignment.
- Multiple sets with efficient union.
- More idea? Please add request and I will try to see what I can do.

Please note that due to potentially extreme performance requirement, there will be no holding back.
Magical perfect hashing and bit manipulation can be used.
